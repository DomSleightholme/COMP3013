**Description:**

As a team, RMSD has decided to create a collection of mini games in a multiplayer format of up to 8 people. These games will include a Bumper Cars style game, a Hungry Hippos styled one, and finally a obstacle course race style one.
Each mini-game will be played on a “board” where the players are racing via points to reach the end and win. Points are won by completing each mini-game.
Our final vision is to have a working version of the game out on Itch.io for people to openly experience it with others.
